# Excel-Challenge

## Background:

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.



## Project:
The goal of this project is to analyze Kickstarter projects data and provide insight to investers who would like to invest in Kickstarter projects. Conditional formatting helps to distinguish different status and highlight percent of fund raised compared to initial goals of each projects. In order to provide invester or client a better visualization on the percentages of successes and failures of different types of projects, pivot tables are applied and pivot charts are created based on all the projects of different categories and sub-categories. All the data, including pivot tables and charts, are saved in the file 'Kickstarter Project Data.xlsx'.
After all, a report was written and saved in 'Kickstarter Project Analysis.docx' to conclude the results.
